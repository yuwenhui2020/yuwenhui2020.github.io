It's just what I needed. You picked up my pieces in my nova king And I'm addicted to when nothing else matters. When we're together, no one else exists when I'm with you, you help me escape. You take me away. I have you to think. You've made me smile again. I've never known someone so perfect. You made it also worth it. The pain in the fears have withered away, and I'm not afraid. I'm running straight into you. And what can I do? You've got me all wrapped up in you. I like where this is going. So good, but terrifying at the same time. It's never been like this before. 
I have you to think you made me smile again..I never know someone so perfect. You may know, I'll never know. I'll never know you just what I needed. You picked up my pieces in my nova, came and I'm addicted to you. When nothing just matters, we together. No one else exists when I'm with you. You help me escape. You take me away. I have you to think. You've made me smile again. I never know someone so perfect. You made it also pain in the fears have we the way? And I'm not afraid I'm running straight into you. And what can I do? You've got me all wrapped up in you like, where this is going. So good, but terrifying at the same time. Has never been like this before. 
I have you to think You made me smile again..I never know someone so perfect You made it all I'll never know. I'll never know I never knows I never knows I know someone so perfect You made it all so thick The pain in your feet I believe it away And I'm not afraid I'm running straight into I'll never know. 
I'll never know. I never know..
这正是我所需要的。你拿起了我的在我的新星国王的碎片，当其他事情都不重要的时候，我上瘾了。当我们在一起时，我和你在一起时，没有其他人存在，你帮我逃跑。你带我走。我得让你想想。你让我再次微笑。我从没见过这么完美的人。你让这一切都变得值得。恐惧中的痛苦已经消失，而我并不害怕。我直接撞到你了。我能做什么？你让我为你神魂颠倒。我喜欢这个方向。很好，但同时也很恐怖。以前从来没有这样过。
我想你让我又笑了。我从未见过如此完美的人。你可能知道，我永远不会知道。我永远不会知道你是我想要的。你在我的新星里捡起我的碎片，来了，我对你上瘾了。当一切都不重要，我们在一起。我和你在一起的时候，没有其他人存在。你帮我逃跑。你带我走。我得让你想想。你让我再次微笑。我从未见过如此完美的人。你使它也痛苦在恐惧中我们有办法吗？而且我不怕我直接撞到你。我能做什么？你让我沉浸在你的世界里，就像你说的那样。很好，但同时也很恐怖。以前从来没有这样过。
我想你让我再次微笑。我从未见过如此完美的人，你创造了我从未知道的一切。我永远不知道我永远不知道我永远不知道我认识一个如此完美的人你把一切都弄得如此沉重你脚上的疼痛我相信它消失了我不害怕我径直奔向我永远不知道。
我永远不会知道。我从来都不知道。
