Garcia\/Uzoechi Emenike\n[00:00.003] Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[00:01.309] Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo\n[00:03.436] Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[00:05.387] Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[00:06.875]\n[00:06.983] In a whole 'nother life, there was this boy that I knew\n[00:11.090] He made me feel like a woman\n[00:13.210] We were young and silly fools\n[00:14.922] Anyway, he was in a band\n[00:17.121] Wrote love songs about me\n[00:19.068] I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet\n[00:22.756] Went something like\n[00:23.429]\n[00:23.437] Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[00:25.288] Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo\n[00:27.545] Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[00:29.378] Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[00:31.203]\n[00:31.226] Every time we go dancing, I see his straying eyes\n[00:35.132] Gave him too many chances, push my gears too many times\n[00:39.000] Anyway, he start acting dumb, then I'll be on my way to leave\n[00:43.076] But I stopped in the tracks when I heard this melody\n[00:46.929] And it went like\n[00:47.364]\n[00:47.397] Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[00:49.350] Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo\n[00:51.562] Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[00:53.446] Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[00:54.593]\n[00:54.929] He used to sing me sweet melodies\n[00:59.244] He played me, made me believe it was real love\n[01:03.678] Sang me sweet melodies\n[01:06.335] But the day he did me wrong\n[01:08.403] The song couldn't go on and on and on\n[01:10.941] He used to sing me sweet melodies\n[01:15.168] He played me, made me believe it was real love\n[01:19.663] Sang me sweet melodies\n[01:22.255] But the day he did me wrong\n[01:24.477] The song couldn't go on and on and on\n[01:26.698]\n[01:26.896] He would lie, he would cheat, over syncopated beats\n[01:31.157] I was just his tiny dancer, he had control of my feet\n[01:35.098] That's when he came along, that's when I lost the groove\n[01:38.945] There was no song in the world\n[01:40.897] To sing along or make me move\n[01:42.962] Sounded something like\n[01:43.532]\n[01:43.557] Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[01:45.231] Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (It was)\n[01:47.715] Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[01:49.415] Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (Oh)\n[01:50.650]\n[01:50.888] He used to sing me sweet melodies (Oh-woah)\n[01:55.279] He played me, made me believe it was real love\n[01:59.530] Sang me sweet melodies\n[02:02.407] But the day he did me wrong (Ah, yeah)\n[02:04.487] The song couldn't go on and on and on (Couldn't go on, no)\n[02:06.919] He

wrong)\n[02:20.345] The song couldn't go on and on and on\n[02:23.358]\n[02:23.652] Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[02:25.507] Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (Oh)\n[02:27.572] Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo\n[02:29.540] Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (Oh, woah)\n[02:30.910]\n[02:31.185] On and on, on and on\n[02:38.838] He used to sing me sweet melodies\n[02:43.307] He played me, made
